# Machine-Learning- Object Detector

As part of the challenge, worked on identifying objects within a series of images. The objects I needed to identify were:

Laptop, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Football Ball (Soccer Ball), Bee, Train, Letter M, Letter T

The goals were the following:
1. Identify as many as you can of these items or letters explicitly in any image provided.
2. Make it easy to supply in new images and report visible objects from the list
Bonus goals:
3. Determine the number of each of these items in a picture.
4. Identify other items outside of the list.
